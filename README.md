## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to work with multiple background images in a container and also how to work with a min-height as opposed to a set height.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to explore how to work with EM and REM for working with responsive layouts for fonts, margins, and padding.


### Useful resources
